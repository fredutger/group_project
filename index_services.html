<h2> Osteo Arthritis </h2>
<p> Arthritis is a serious condition. One in five Canadians live every day with arthritis and there is no cure. It is more common in women than men (1 in 4 women, compared to 1 in 6 men). It can strike people of any age. Though more common at older ages, over half of Canadians with arthritis are younger than 65. </p>

<p> To keep yourself active and moving well, let me refer you to a video by The Arthritis Society which will provide recommendations and guidelines in mobility promotion.</p>

<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis. It affects more Canadians than all other forms of arthritis combined. OA is a progressive disease of the whole joint that leads to breakdown of joint cartilage and the underlying bone. It used to be described as a degenerative or “wear-and-tear” arthritis, but recent studies describe it as a result of the body’s failed attempt to repair damaged joint tissues. </p>

<p>Early signs of OA include joint pain, swelling, crepitus and instability. An affected joint may give way or buckle, and not function as well as it should. Commonly affected joints are hands, hips and knees, and diagnosis is often made based on symptoms and physical examination. </p>

<p>Therapeutic self management should include weight management, limiting saturated and trans fats reducing sugar intake, and increasing the fruit and vegetable components in the diet. </p>

<p>Application of cold to inflamed joints, and using hot packs or warm showers for pain and stiffness are beneficial. </p>

<p>Frequently recommended supplements include Vitamin D, Glucosamine and Chondroitin. If you are interested in trying these, speak with your health care provider for a trial regimen and follow-up assessment of their benefit. </p>

<p>Light to moderate physical activity can also be beneficial for its strengthening of muscles supporting affected joints, increased blood flow provision and promotion of normal joint regeneration. For further information on beneficial exercise, see: </p>

<h2>Athlete's Foot</h2>
<!––Add Athlete's Foot Images––>

<p>Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection that is often found between and behind the toes. It can also be widespread over the bottom surface of the foot. The skin may appear either white (macerated d/t dampness) with peeling or cracks, and or itchy, red and irritated. As any break in the skin's surface is a portal of entry for organisms, treatment is recommended.</p>

<p>Cleaning the feet daily and drying well, wearing clean and roomy cotton socks and changing them daily are important. Alternating shoes every day is also a good practice, as this allows the shoes to dry well between wearings. If this is not possible, antifungal sprays are available for treatment purposes. Topical over-the-counter antifungal preparations can be quite effective in treating and preventing most fungal organisms.</p>

<h2>Bunions and Bunionettes</h2>

<p>A bunion develops when there is a gradual dislocation of the great toe joint, whereas a bunionette develops at the base of the little toe either by enlargement or misalignment of the 5th metatarsal bone. Both can result from genetic predisposition, foot injuries, inflammatory arthritic conditions, or misalignment of the foot. The most frequent cause, however, is the wearing of shoes that squeeze the toes into an abnormal position.</p>

<p>Characteristic symptoms include the presence of a bony prominence, and pain--especially when wearing shoes that press against the prominence.</p>

<p>Having feet properly sized, wearing well-fitting, low(er) heeled shoes, avoiding shoes + sandals that irritate those points on the foot that are affected, padding the area or having the area of the boney prominence stretched on shoes are non-surgical means of treating bunions and bunionettes that can be effective.</p>
