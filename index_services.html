<h2> Osteo Arthritis </h2>
<p> Arthritis is a serious condition. One in five Canadians live every day with arthritis and there is no cure. It is more common in women than men (1 in 4 women, compared to 1 in 6 men). It can strike people of any age. Though more common at older ages, over half of Canadians with arthritis are younger than 65. </p>

<p> To keep yourself active and moving well, let me refer you to a video by The Arthritis Society which will provide recommendations and guidelines in mobility promotion.</p>

<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis. It affects more Canadians than all other forms of arthritis combined. OA is a progressive disease of the whole joint that leads to breakdown of joint cartilage and the underlying bone. It used to be described as a degenerative or “wear-and-tear” arthritis, but recent studies describe it as a result of the body’s failed attempt to repair damaged joint tissues. </p>

<p>Early signs of OA include joint pain, swelling, crepitus and instability. An affected joint may give way or buckle, and not function as well as it should. Commonly affected joints are hands, hips and knees, and diagnosis is often made based on symptoms and physical examination. </p>

<p>Therapeutic self management should include weight management, limiting saturated and trans fats reducing sugar intake, and increasing the fruit and vegetable components in the diet. </p>

<p>Application of cold to inflamed joints, and using hot packs or warm showers for pain and stiffness are beneficial. </p>

<p>Frequently recommended supplements include Vitamin D, Glucosamine and Chondroitin. If you are interested in trying these, speak with your health care provider for a trial regimen and follow-up assessment of their benefit. </p>

<p>Light to moderate physical activity can also be beneficial for its strengthening of muscles supporting affected joints, increased blood flow provision and promotion of normal joint regeneration. For further information on beneficial exercise, see: </p>

<h2>Athlete's Foot</h2>
<!––Add Athlete's Foot Images––>

<p>Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection that is often found between and behind the toes. It can also be widespread over the bottom surface of the foot. The skin may appear either white (macerated d/t dampness) with peeling or cracks, and or itchy, red and irritated. As any break in the skin's surface is a portal of entry for organisms, treatment is recommended.</p>

<p>Cleaning the feet daily and drying well, wearing clean and roomy cotton socks and changing them daily are important. Alternating shoes every day is also a good practice, as this allows the shoes to dry well between wearings. If this is not possible, antifungal sprays are available for treatment purposes. Topical over-the-counter antifungal preparations can be quite effective in treating and preventing most fungal organisms.</p>

<h2>Bunions and Bunionettes</h2>
<!––Add Bunion and Bunionette Image––>

<p>A bunion develops when there is a gradual dislocation of the great toe joint, whereas a bunionette develops at the base of the little toe either by enlargement or misalignment of the 5th metatarsal bone. Both can result from genetic predisposition, foot injuries, inflammatory arthritic conditions, or misalignment of the foot. The most frequent cause, however, is the wearing of shoes that squeeze the toes into an abnormal position.</p>

<p>Characteristic symptoms include the presence of a bony prominence, and pain--especially when wearing shoes that press against the prominence.</p>

<p>Having feet properly sized, wearing well-fitting, low(er) heeled shoes, avoiding shoes + sandals that irritate those points on the foot that are affected, padding the area or having the area of the boney prominence stretched on shoes are non-surgical means of treating bunions and bunionettes that can be effective.</p>

<h2>Foot Callus & Corns</h2>
<!––Add Foot Callus and Corns Image––>

<p>The formation of callus is a protective mechanism of the skin in response to external mechanical irritation and all skin has the capacity to do so. The skin becomes irritated and thickens in response to this mechanical irritation. This thickening of the skin is what we call callus.</p>

<p>Callus formation on the foot results from external pressure from the ground, shoes, or an adjacent toe that pushes against an underlying boney prominence. They are most commonly found on the bottom + sides of the foot. As the thickness and firmness of the tissue becomes greater, the risk for the development of ulcerations beneath the skin rises. Since the feet carry the body’s weight, treatment of callus build-up can have significant preventative care benefit.</p>

<p>Corns are callus formations which generally occur on the tops and sides of the toes and at the joints. There a number of different types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <b>hard corn</b> is a small patch of thickened, dead skin with a packed center typically occurring on a joint as a result of pressure or repetitive irritation.</li>
  <li>A <b>soft corn</b> occurs between the toes due to pressure by an enlarged joint. It typically has a thinner surface, and may have a tough, rubbery, white centre, and/or a macerated texture resulting from moisture retention between the toes. Soft corns are most common between the 4th and 5th toes,but can be found between any of the toes. It typically feels like a tiny stone or object on the base of the foot. This type of corn can penetrate deeply and is prone to becoming inflamed or infected. They should be monitored and treated accordingly.</li>
  <li>A <b>seed corn</b> is a tiny, distinct callous that can either asymptomatic, or very tender, and can similar to a tiny pebble in your shoe when walking or bearing weight. They tend to occur on dried skin on the bottom of the foot and are believed to be caused by either skin dryness or the presence of increased amounts of cholesterol in the pores of the skin. Reduction or removal of the corn reduces the discomfort, but this type of corn may reoccur.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hammer, Claw, and Mallet Toes</h2>

<p>The terms Claw, Hammer and Mallet are used to describe toes that are fixed in an abnormal position. They may or may not be associated with pain, corns or calluses, and affect only the four smaller toes of the foot. They tend to form progressively with aging, and are more often associated with women than men. Primarily because women often wear shoes with narrow toes or high heels.</p>

<p>These types of toe issues can also be linked with other conditions, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, synovitis, neurological disorders or an injury to the foot or ankle.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hammer toes usually affect the 2nd toe and often occur with bunions. They affect the middle joint of the toe which rises up as the distal part of the toe bends toward the floor, causing the soft pad of the toe to be in contact with the ground. A hammertoe can be caused by genetic predisposition, arthritis, injury or with aging.</li>
</ul>

<!––Add Hammer Toe Image––>

<ul>
<li>In a Claw toe, the first toe joint also rises and both the middle and distal joints curl down like a claw, such that the unprotected tip of the toe is in contact with the ground. Pain, corn and callus development may result from pressure.</li>
</ul>

<!––Add Claw Toe Image––>

<ul>
<li>A Mallet toe bends down at the smallest joint closest to the tip of the toe, and the unprotected tip also has contact with the ground. It is most common in adults, and found equally between men and women.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cracked Heels</h2>

<!––Add Cracked Heels Image––>

<p>Cracked heels or heel fissures represent a break in the skin, the first line of the body’s defense against infection. They are commonly caused by dry skin, prolonged standing on hard floors, wearing open-heeled shoes or sandals, and obesity (increases pressure on the fat pad under the heel, causing it to expand sideways) are all capable of contributing to this problem. Certain medical conditions such as diabetes, an underactive thyroid, psoriasis and eczema can also cause the skin to become dry and cracked.</p>

<p>Fissures and pain are typically worse when the skin around the rim of the heel is thick (callus). Debridement of callus, moisturization, and heel support are key when it comes to the management of symptoms and recovery.</p>

<h2>Fungal Nails</h2>

<!––Add Fungal Nails Image––>

<p>Fungal infection of the nails, or onychomycosis, affects about 10% of people and is more common in toenails than fingernails. These infections can result in nail deformity that can cause problems with walking, exercise or proper shoe fitting, and be a significant predictor in the development of foot ulcers.</p>

<p>Recent research suggests that there may also be a genetic predisposition for susceptibility to fungal infections. Fungal infections can be spread through contact with an infected person, or from contact with a surface where the fungus is present. Other facilitators of a fungal infection include a hot, humid climate, use of common showers and commercial swimming pools, and wearing closed-in or tight shoes. People with diabetes are three times more likely to develop nail fungus.</p>

<p>Medical treatment for onychomycosis can include oral (pills/capsules taken by mouth), Near InfraRed A light therapy, laser, or topical solutions (applied directly onto +/or under the affected nail). In addition there are numerous home remedies such as vinegar and water soaks, tea tree oil soaks, Vicks VapoRub, among others, the effectiveness of which have varied or limited evidentiary substantiation.</p>

<h2>Gout</h2>

<!––Add Gout Image––>

<p><b>Gout</b> is an extremely painful type of inflammatory arthritis caused by small, sharp crystals of a chemical called uric acid that form in the joints. The body’s immune system attacks these crystals, causing pain, redness and swelling in the joint and sometimes in the surrounding tissue. Diet is often highly implicated as a causative factor, but others may include genetic predisposition or family history, certain medications such as diuretics (water pills), and chronic renal disease or failure.</p>

<p>Gout is characterized by both active and inactive periods.  Active periods are known as “attacks” and can vary in length and severity. They can occur in any joint, but more commonly affect the knees, ankles and feet. The big toe is often the site of an initial attack. They usually last from 3 to 10 days. Without treatment, attacks can occur again, increase in frequency and can last longer. Recurrences can lead to permanent joint damage so early diagnosis and treatment are important.</p>

<p>If you think you are experiencing a gout attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ice, elevate and rest the affected joint</li>
  <li>Drink plenty of fluids, but no alcohol, pop or sugary drinks</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the joint(s) involved, the intensity and changes in pain, the length of the attack</li>
  <li>Call your doctor to book an appointment to be assessed and have blood work done; take anti-inflammatory medication as prescribed, and make necessary changes in diet as directed to reduce risk of reoccurence.</li>
  <li>Relax —avoid stress since it can aggravate gout</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingrown Nails</h2>

<p>Ingrown toe nails are often the result of poor nail cutting or injury to the nail, which leave a rough or sharp edge which cuts into the skin as the nail grows. They may also result from pressure from poorly-fitting shoes.</p>

<p>In response, the body initiates an inflammatory process in an effort to prevent an infection from developing. Since the penetrating nail is the source of the wound, the wound cannot completely close, resulting in the entry of bacteria to the area, followed by pain and the signs and symptoms of localized infection, swelling, pain, yellow or bloody drainage, difficulty wearing shoes, and so forth. If not treated promptly, the infection can intensify and spread. For those with peripheral arterial disease or diabetes, it could lead to bone infection and even amputations.</p>

<p>Acute infections must be treated by a physician, and situations of recurrence or required surgical intervention are referred to a podiatrist or chiropodist.</p>

<p>Conservative ingrown toenail treatment at inStepfoot footcare involves pre-soaking the toe in an Epsom salt bath to reduce inflammation and discomfort, and either trimming and removal of the offending nail edge or packing, if deemed appropriate for the client. A post-treatment follow-up assessment is provided to ensure that the nail continues to grow out in the proper manner.</p>

<h2>Involuted Nails</h2>

<!––Add Involuted Nails Image––>

<p>Involuted nails grow in an arched shape and may sometimes curl around in a complete circle if curvature is not treated early. They can be quite difficult to clip and can become very painful if they pinch the enclosed skin.</p>

<p>Involuted nails can be treated with nail softeners, reduction of the nail, clipping, or bracing depending on the degree of the curvature and nail thickness. The obvious solution is to correct the curving of the toenail. Bracing the nail straightens nail curvature by lifting the nail edges, thereby reducing pressure against the skin.</p>

<h2>Neuropathy</h2>

<p>Peripheral neuropathy is a disorder that occurs as a result of damaged or destruction of peripheral nerves, disrupting their normal functioning. It can result from injury, illness, infection, an inherited disorder, or toxins.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of peripheral nerves in the body--sensory nerves, which connect to your skin; motor nerves, which connect to your muscles; autonomic nerves, which connect to your internal organs. Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve group or all three.</p>

<p>Symptoms most often experienced in the feet include:</p>
